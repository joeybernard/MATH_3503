These are derivative functions, made up of first derivatives of one independent variable. In the most general case, these look like\n\\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)\\)\nIn the special case where f(x,y) is actually only a function of x (i.e., f(x,y) = f(x)), then the most general form of a solution looks like\n\\(y(x) = \\int f(x) dx\\)\nIn this section, we will look at various techniques that can be used to solve other forms of first order ODEs. In all of the following cases, we may or may not have an initial condition. When we do, this initial condition can be used to determine any constants of integration that pop up during calculating the solution.",

    "text": "2.4 Exact/Homogeneous\nExact equations are special first order ODEs that are derived from a potential function. These are common types of equations that occur in physics and engineering. In these types of cases, you have a potential field that defines the behaviour described by the differential equation. In the general case, we may have the potential defined by\n\\(F(x,y)\\)\nIn this general case, we can look at the total derivative of F(x,y).\n\\(dF = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} dy\\)\nThis should look familiar from the MATH 2513 class, when you covered partial differential equations. We can use shorter nomenclature and rewrite this as\n\\(dF = M(x,y) dx + N(x,y) dy\\)\nIf we assume that the potential function is a constant function, then we know that \\(dF = 0\\), and we can rewrite our equation as\n\\(M(x,y) dx + N(x,y) dy = 0\\)\nThis nows looks like something that we may run into when working with first order ODEs. Specifically, this is a homogeneous ODE. If we can write our problem equation in this form, we can work backwards to discover what the solution is. The first step is to integrate either M or N. You usually pick whichever one is simpler to work with. In the M case, we end up with\n\\(F = \\int M dx + C(y)\\)\nThe important part is the extra term of C(y). You then take this solution for F(x,y) and take the derivative with respect to y. You then set this equal to N, in order to solve for what C(y) is. You can also start by integrating N first, and you end up with an extra term of C(x).\n\\(F = \\int N dy + C(x)\\)\nWe can now take the derivative with respect to x and set it equal M. In this way, we can solve for C(x).\nIn some cases, an equation of the form\n\\(M dx + N dy = 0\\)\nactually isn’t exact. If we aren’t sure, we can test for exactness by checking to see if we have\n\\(\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x}\\)\nThis comes from the fact that both M and N are partial derivatives of the potential function F. If you remember from MATH 2513, we have\n\\(\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial y \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\)\nSo, if we fail this test, what can we do? In these cases, we can multiply by an integrating factor to get it into an exact form. There is a derivation of how to get the following equation, but we can use\n\\(P(x) = \\frac{M_y - N_x}{N}\\)\nto find a function. This becomes our integrating factor, that we can substitute into\n\\(e^{\\int P(x) dx} (M dx + N dy) = 0\\)\nThis new equation is now exact, and we can use the above technique to solve for a solution.",

If we do this, we end up with\n\\(y^{''} + p(x) y^{'} + q(x) y = f(x)\\)\nThe first class of second order ODEs we will look at are homogeneous equations. This is the special case of setting \\(f(x) = 0\\). We will also further constrain the equations for this section by only looking at constant coefficients. This special case looks like\n\\(y^{''} + b y^{'} + c y = 0\\)\nIn the most general case, there should be two linearly independent solutions (\\(y_1 and y_2\\)) that combine to make the general solution. This general solution looks like\n\\(y = C_1 y_1 + C_2 y_2\\)\nYou can check for linear independence by using the Wronskian. If we have linear independence, then we have\n\\(\\begin{vmatrix}\ny_1 & y_2 \\\\\ny^{'}_1 & y^{'}_2\n\\end{vmatrix} \\ne 0\\)\nIn order to find these two solutions to the differential equation, we start by setting up the characteristic equation that is associated with the differential equation. This characteristic equation is given by\n\\(a r^2 + b r + c = 0\\)\nWe can then find out what the two values for r are.
